# Exercise 1

-   **Take a look at the following visualization.**
   -   For each group of text labels, note how one would add and modify them.
   -   Discuss how to automate the placement of the labels in- and outside of the bars.


*Add your answers here.*



# Exercise 2

-   **Create a function that plots the famous Gapminder chart, highlighting one of the continents.**
   -   Extend the code in `02-text-exercises.qmd` to annotate a continent your choice of with {ggforce}.
   -   Turn the code into a function with the utility to annotate any continent.
   -   Optional: Create a second function to highlight a country.
